## What is JoFotara?

**JoFotara** is Jordan's national electronic invoicing system, launched by the **Income and Sales Tax Department (ISTD)** in collaboration with the **Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship (MDEE)**. It aims to:
- Enhance transparency in sales and purchase transactions.
- Streamline tax data collection for the ISTD.
- Modernize Jordan’s tax infrastructure by digitizing invoicing processes.

### Key Features of JoFotara
- **Electronic Invoice Submission**: Businesses submit invoices via the JoFotara portal or integrated systems.
- **QR Code Verification**: After submission, the ISTD generates a QR code to be included on invoices, ensuring they are tax-compliant and verified.
- **Compliance**: Mandatory for Business-to-Government (B2G) transactions since May 2024; encouraged for all businesses to improve accountability.
- **Phase 2 Implementation**: Starting April 1, 2025, all goods and services transactions will require tax-compliant e-invoices for tax deductions.

JoFotara addresses Jordan’s previous lack of a unified invoicing system, simplifying tax reporting and reducing fraudulent practices.
